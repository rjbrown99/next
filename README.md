# Patches for NeXTStep and OpenStep

This archive contains patches to generally available open source software to enable compilation on NeXTStep 3.3 and OpenStep 4.2.

While many packages exist in pre-packaged binary form elsewhere, the goal of this repository is to memorialize the actual source code patches required to compile software, either with the built-in cc or with gcc.

Additional packages have been added as needed, such as an implementation of uname.

Contributions are welcome.

Also check out the wiki for compile instructions for other packages that don't require a patch and the preferred installation order.
